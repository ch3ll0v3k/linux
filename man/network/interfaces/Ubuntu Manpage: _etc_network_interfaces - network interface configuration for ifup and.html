</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/etc/network/interfaces">/etc/network/interfaces</a>  - network interface configuration for ifup and
       ifdown

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/etc/network/interfaces">/etc/network/interfaces</a>  contains   network   interface   configuration
       information  for the <b><a href="../man8/ifup.8.html">ifup</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man8/ifdown.8.html">ifdown</a></b>(8) commands.  This is where you
       configure how your system is connected to the network.

       Lines starting with `#' are ignored. Note that end-of-line comments are
       NOT supported, comments must be on a line of their own.

       A  line  may  be  extended  across  multiple  lines  by making the last
       character a backslash.

       The file consists of zero or more "iface", "mapping", "auto",  "allow-"
       and "source" stanzas. Here is an example.
       auto lo eth0
       allow-hotplug eth1

       iface lo inet loopback

       source interfaces.d/machine-dependent

       mapping eth0
            script /usr/local/sbin/map-scheme
            map HOME eth0-home
            map WORK eth0-work

       iface eth0-home inet static
            address 192.168.1.1
            netmask 255.255.255.0
            up flush-mail

       iface eth0-work inet dhcp

       iface eth1 inet dhcp
       Lines  beginning with the word "auto" are used to identify the physical
       interfaces to be brought up when <b>ifup</b> is run with the <b>-a</b> option.  (This
       option  is  used by the system boot scripts.)  Physical interface names
       should follow the word "auto" on the same line.  There can be  multiple
       "auto"  stanzas.   <b>ifup</b>  brings  the  named  interfaces up in the order
       listed.

       Lines beginning with "allow-" are  used  to  identify  interfaces  that
       should  be  brought  up automatically by various subsytems. This may be
       done using a command such as "ifup --allow=hotplug  eth0  eth1",  which
       will  only  bring up eth0 or eth1 if it is listed in an "allow-hotplug"
       line. Note that "allow-auto" and "auto" are synonyms.

       Lines beginning with "source" are used to include  stanzas  from  other
       files, so configuration can be split into many files. The word "source"
       is followed by the path of file to be sourced. Shell wildcards  can  be
       used.  (See <b><a href="../man3/wordexp.3.html">wordexp</a></b>(3) for details.)

       Stanzas  beginning  with the word "mapping" are used to determine how a
       logical interface name is chosen for a physical interface that is to be
       brought  up.   The  first line of a mapping stanza consists of the word
       "mapping" followed by a pattern in shell  glob  syntax.   Each  mapping
       stanza  must contain a <b>script</b> definition.  The named script is run with
       the physical interface name as its argument and with  the  contents  of
       all  following  "map"  lines  (<b>without</b> the leading "map") in the stanza
       provided to it on its standard input. The script must print a string on
       its        standard        output       before       exiting.       See
       <u><a href="file:/usr/share/doc/ifupdown/examples">/usr/share/doc/ifupdown/examples</a></u> for examples of what the  script  must
       print.

       Mapping a name consists of searching the remaining mapping patterns and
       running the script corresponding to the first match; the script outputs
       the name to which the original is mapped.

       <b>ifup</b>  is  normally  given  a  physical  interface  name  as  its  first
       non-option argument.  <b>ifup</b> also uses this name as the  initial  logical
       name  for  the  interface  unless it is accompanied by a  suffix of the
       form <u>=LOGICAL</u>, in which  case  ifup  chooses  <u>LOGICAL</u>  as  the  initial
       logical  name for the interface.  It then maps this name, possibly more
       than once according to successive  mapping  specifications,   until  no
       further  mappings  are  possible.  If the resulting name is the name of
       some defined logical interface then  <b>ifup</b>  attempts  to  bring  up  the
       physical  interface  as  that  logical interface.  Otherwise <b>ifup</b> exits
       with an error.

       Stanzas defining logical interfaces start with a line consisting of the
       word  "iface" followed by the name of the logical interface.  In simple
       configurations without mapping stanzas this name should simply  be  the
       name  of  the  physical  interface  to which it is to be applied.  (The
       default mapping script is, in effect, the <b>echo</b> command.)  The interface
       name  is  followed by the name of the address family that the interface
       uses.  This will be "inet" for TCP/IP networking,  but  there  is  also
       some support for IPX networking ("ipx"), and IPv6 networking ("inet6").
       Following that is  the  name  of  the  method  used  to  configure  the
       interface.

       Additional  options  can  be  given  on subsequent lines in the stanza.
       Which options are available  depends  on  the  family  and  method,  as
       described  below.   Additional  options  can be made available by other
       Debian  packages.   For  example,  the  wireless-tools  package   makes
       available  a  number  of options prefixed with "wireless-" which can be
       used to configure the interface using  <b><a href="../man8/iwconfig.8.html">iwconfig</a></b>(8)<b>.</b>   (See  <b><a href="../man7/wireless.7.html">wireless</a></b>(7)
       for details.)

       Options  are usually indented for clarity (as in the example above) but
       are not required to be.

</pre><h4><b>IFACE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following "command" options are  available  for  every  family  and
       method.   Each of these options can be given multiple times in a single
       stanza, in which case the commands are executed in the order  in  which
       they  appear  in  the stanza.  (You can ensure a command never fails by
       suffixing "|| true".)

       <b>pre-up</b> <u>command</u>
              Run <u>command</u> before bringing the interface up.  If  this  command
              fails then <b>ifup</b> aborts, refraining from marking the interface as
              configured, prints an error message, and exits  with  status  0.
              This behavior may change in the future.

       <b>up</b> <u>command</u>

       <b>post-up</b> <u>command</u>
              Run  <u>command</u>  after  bringing the interface up.  If this command
              fails then <b>ifup</b> aborts, refraining from marking the interface as
              configured  (even  though it has really been configured), prints
              an error message, and exits with status 0.   This  behavior  may
              change in the future.

       <b>down</b> <u>command</u>

       <b>pre-down</b> <u>command</u>
              Run  <u>command</u>  before taking the interface down.  If this command
              fails then <b>ifdown</b> aborts, marks the  interface  as  deconfigured
              (even  though  it  has  not really been deconfigured), and exits
              with status 0.  This behavior may change in the future.

       <b>post-down</b> <u>command</u>
              Run <u>command</u> after taking the interface down.   If  this  command
              fails  then  <b>ifdown</b> aborts, marks the interface as deconfigured,
              and exits with status  0.   This  behavior  may  change  in  the
              future.

       There  exists  for  each  of  the  above  mentioned options a directory
       <u>/etc/network/if-</u><b>&lt;option&gt;</b><u>.d/</u> the scripts  in  which  are  run  (with  no
       arguments)   using  <b><a href="../man8/run-parts.8.html">run-parts</a></b>(8)  after  the  option  itself  has  been
       processed. Please note that as <b>post-up</b> and  <b>pre-down</b>  are  aliases,  no
       files  in  the corresponding directories are processed.  Please use <u>if-</u>
       <u>up.d</u> and <u>if-down.d</u> directories instead.

       All  of  these  commands  have  access  to  the  following  environment
       variables.

       <b>IFACE</b>  physical name of the interface being processed

       <b>LOGICAL</b>
              logical name of the interface being processed

       <b>ADDRFAM</b>
              address family of the interface

       <b>METHOD</b> method of the interface (e.g., <u>static</u>)

       <b>MODE</b>   <u>start</u> if run from ifup, <u>stop</u> if run from ifdown

       <b>PHASE</b>  as per MODE, but with finer granularity, distinguishing the <u>pre-</u>
              <u>up</u>, <u>post-up</u>, <u>pre-down</u> and <u>post-down</u> phases.

       <b>VERBOSITY</b>
              indicates whether <b>--verbose</b> was used; set to 1 if so, 0 if not.

       <b>PATH</b>   the  command   search   path:   <u><a href="file:/usr/local/sbin">/usr/local/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>:‚</u>Äê
              <u><a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>:<a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a></u>

       Additionally,  all  options given in an interface definition stanza are
       exported to the environment in upper case with "IF_" prepended and with
       hyphens   converted  to  underscores  and  non-alphanumeric  characters
       discarded.

       of <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> commands or /etc/network/if-*.d scripts.

       <b>Options</b>

              (No options)

   <b>The</b> <b>dhcp</b> <b>Method</b>
       This method may be used to obtain an address via DHCP with any  of  the
       tools:  dhclient, pump, udhcpc, dhcpcd. (They have been listed in their
       order of precedence.) If you have a complicated DHCP setup  you  should
       note  that  some of these clients use their own configuration files and
       do not obtain their configuration information via <b>ifup</b>.

       <b>Options</b>

                     Use the  IP  address  <u>address</u>  to  communicate  with  the
                     server.

              <b>hwaddr</b> <u>addr</u>
                     Use  <u>addr</u>  as the hardware address instead of whatever it
                     really is.

   <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>Method</b>
       This method is used to create GRE or IPIP tunnels. You need to have the
       <b>ip</b>  binary  from the <b>iproute</b> package. For GRE tunnels, you will need to
       load the ip_gre module and the ipip module for IPIP tunnels.

       <b>Options</b>

   <b>The</b> <b>ppp</b> <b>Method</b>
       This method uses pon/poff to  configure  a  PPP  interface.  See  those
       commands for details.

       <b>Options</b>

              <b>provider</b> <u>name</u>
                     Use <u>name</u> as the provider (from <a href="file:/etc/ppp/peers">/etc/ppp/peers</a>).

                     Use <u>number</u> as the ppp unit number.

              <b>options</b> <u>string</u>
                     Pass <u>string</u> as additional options to pon.

   <b>The</b> <b>wvdial</b> <b>Method</b>
       This  method uses wvdial to configure a PPP interface. See that command
       for more details.

       <b>Options</b>

              <b>provider</b> <u>name</u>
                     Use <u>name</u> as the provider (from /etc/wvdial.conf).

   <b>The</b> <b>ipv4ll</b> <b>Method</b>
       This method uses avahi-autoipd to configure an interface with  an  IPv4
       Link-Layer  address  (169.254.0.0/16 family). This method is also known
       as APIPA or IPAC, and  often  colloquially  referred  to  as  "Zeroconf
       address".

       <b>Options</b>

              (No options)

</pre><h4><b>IPX</b> <b>ADDRESS</b> <b>FAMILY</b></h4><pre>
       This section documents the methods available in the ipx address family.

   <b>The</b> <b>static</b> <b>Method</b>
       This  method  may  be  used  to setup an IPX interface. It requires the
       <u>ipx_interface</u> command.

       <b>Options</b>

              <b>frame</b> <u>type</u>
                     <u>type</u> of ethernet frames to use (e.g. <b>802.2</b>)

              <b>netnum</b> <u>id</u>
                     Network number

   <b>The</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>Method</b>
       This method may be used to setup an IPX interface dynamically.

       <b>Options</b>

              <b>frame</b> <u>type</u>
                     <u>type</u> of ethernet frames to use (e.g. <b>802.2</b>)

</pre><h4><b>INET6</b> <b>ADDRESS</b> <b>FAMILY</b></h4><pre>
       This section documents the  methods  available  in  the  inet6  address
       family.

   <b>The</b> <b>auto</b> <b>Method</b>
       This  method  may  be  used  to  define  interfaces  with automatically
       assigned IPv6 addresses. Using this method on its own doesn't mean that
       RDNSS  options will be applied, too. To make this happen, <b>rdnssd</b> daemon
       must be installed, properly configured and running. If stateless DHCPv6
       support  is turned on, then additional network configuration parameters
       such as DNS and NTP servers will be retrieved from a DHCP server.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS/LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ifup</b>  and <b>ifdown</b> programs work with so-called "physical" interface
       names.   These  names  are  assigned  to  hardware   by   the   kernel.
       Unfortunately  it can happen that the kernel assigns different physical
       interface names to the same hardware at different times;  for  example,
       what  was  called  "eth0" last time you booted is now called "eth1" and
       vice versa.  This creates a  problem  if  you  want  to  configure  the
       interfaces  appropriately.   A  way to deal with this problem is to use
       mapping scripts that choose logical interface names  according  to  the
       properties  of  the  interface  hardware.   See  the <b>get-mac-address.sh</b>
       script in the examples directory for  an  example  of  such  a  mapping
       script.  See also Debian bug #101728.
